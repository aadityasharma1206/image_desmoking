# De-Smoking Images using GAN with U-Net Generator

This project is based on deep learning techniques for removing smoke from images. It involves the creation of a custom dataset of smoked images and combines it with a pre-existing smoked image dataset. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with U-Net architecture is used to generate clean, de-smoked images.

# Project Overview

This project leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) where a U-Net architecture serves as the generator. The goal is to take smoked images as input and produce de-smoked versions of them. The model is trained using a combination of a custom dataset (generated by applying smoke effects to 50,000 images) and a pre-existing smoked image dataset.

# Features

Custom Dataset: Created 50,000 artificially smoked images and combined them with an existing dataset.
U-Net Generator: Uses a U-Net architecture to process smoked images and output clear, de-smoked images.
GAN Framework: Trained the generator alongside a discriminator to improve the quality of the de-smoked images.
Image Augmentation: Applied various augmentation techniques to enhance model performance and robustness.

# Dataset

Custom Smoked Dataset: 50,000 images were artificially smoked to create a unique dataset.
Combined Dataset: The custom dataset was combined with an existing smoked image dataset to improve generalization.
Data Augmentation: Various image augmentation techniques were used, including rotation, flipping, and cropping, to improve the diversity of the training data.

# Model Architecture

Generator: U-Net architecture, designed to take in smoked images and output de-smoked images.
Discriminator: Trained to differentiate between real de-smoked images and generated ones.
Training Framework: A GAN framework where the generator learns to improve based on feedback from the discriminator.
